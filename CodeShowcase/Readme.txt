Sorry for not including all the source code,
but I have a lot of research and work having
gone into this.

A 2d particle physics simulator, and game engine:
can handle sprites, collisions, physics, char control,
and soft bodies 
(lighting, and normal maps are implemented in code,
but are not showcased atm.).

Use 'A' and 'W' to move left and right,
use 'Ctrl' and 'Space' to move down and up.
